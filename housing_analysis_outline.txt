📄 1. Executive Summary
Project Title: Affordable Housing Market Analysis for Strategic Expansion
Project Sponsor: Fictional Housing Solutions, Inc.
Project Lead: Kalle Reaves
Project Tools: Python (Jupyter Notebook), MSSQL, Apache Superset
Duration: 6 Weeks

This project analyzed the current state of affordable housing across the United States, focusing on identifying optimal states for potential investment by a fictional company. Using a combination of economic data — including Housing Price Index (HPI), median actual housing prices, and wage growth — we developed a series of linear regression models to assess affordability trends.

Our goal was to identify U.S. states where affordable housing developments could be both economically viable and socially impactful. The project relied heavily on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Zillow, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), and the Federal Reserve.

Visual dashboards were created using Apache Superset to communicate findings in a business-friendly format. The project revealed a shortlist of states where the gap between housing cost and wage growth suggests potential for affordable housing initiatives.

⚠️ 8. Risk Management – Risk Register (Example)
ID	Risk Description	Impact	Likelihood	Response Strategy	Owner
R1	Incomplete or outdated wage data	High	Medium	Cross-verify with multiple sources (BLS, Census)	Data Analyst
R2	Model overfitting in regression analysis	Medium	Medium	Regular cross-validation, restrict features	Data Scientist
R3	Superset dashboard rendering errors	Low	Medium	Update Superset, reduce chart complexity	BI Developer
R4	Misalignment between HPI and actual prices	High	Low	Normalize data ranges, test for correlation	Analyst
R5	MSSQL connection drop during data pulls	Medium	Low	Implement retry logic and backup queries	DBA

📊 11. Data Analysis & Results
11.1 Data Sources
Housing Price Index (HPI): Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)

Median Housing Prices: Zillow Housing Data

Wage Growth: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

State-level Attributes: U.S. Census Bureau

11.2 Methodology
Data cleaning and transformation using pandas and numpy

MSSQL used to store and query pre-processed data

Regression models built using scikit-learn:

HPI vs. Median Price

Wage Growth vs. Housing Cost

Combined affordability index per state

11.3 Key Findings
Strong positive correlation between HPI and actual housing prices (R² ≈ 0.89)

Weak to moderate correlation between wage growth and housing affordability (R² ≈ 0.56), suggesting that wages are not keeping pace in many states

Top candidate states for affordable housing development:

Ohio, Michigan, and Texas: High wage growth, moderate housing cost, favorable HPI trends

Avoid: California and New York due to low affordability and high price volatility

11.4 Visual Insights
Heatmaps showing states with the lowest price-to-income ratios

Time series charts comparing historical HPI and wage trends

Bar charts ranking states by projected affordability index
